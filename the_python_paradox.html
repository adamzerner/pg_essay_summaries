			<div class="page-header"><h1>The Python Paradox</h1></div>
			<p>In a recent talk I said something that upset a lot of people: that you could get smarter programmers to work on a Python project than you could to work on a Java project.</p>
			<p>People who learn Python donâ€™t do it to get a job, they do it because they genuinely like programming, and these intrinsically motivated people are usually smarter.</p>
			<p>Python paradox: if a company chooses to write its software in a comparatively esoteric language, they'll be able to hire better programmers, because they'll attract only those who cared enough to learn it. And for programmers the paradox is even more pronounced: the language to learn, if you want to get a good job, is a language that people don't learn merely to get a job.</p>
